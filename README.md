## Trix Camera App

The Trix camera app allows users to apply protective filters (that protect from facial recognition) from their iOS or Android mobile device.

Images taken in Trix are sent to Trix servers (AWS is currently used for hosting) and protected via a model-serving optimized version of [Fawkes](https://github.com/Shawn-Shan/fawkes). Though we are developing a proprietary algorithm to improve upon Fawkes's work, we have no intent to monetize this product and will continue to provide it for free as long as we are able. If our proprietary algorithm comes to fruition, we will open-source this as well. 

**We will never view your images or use your data for purposes other than understanding how users are using our service or improving our product, in aggregate.** Usage information we collect (via Amplitude):
* Photos taken or uploaded to our service
* Photos viewed and deleted from our app
* Photos shared
