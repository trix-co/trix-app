## Trix Camera App

The Trix camera app allows users to apply protective filters (that protect from facial recognition) from their iOS or Android mobile device.

Images taken in Trix are sent to Trix servers (AWS is currently used for hosting) and protected via a model-serving optimized version of [Fawkes](https://github.com/Shawn-Shan/fawkes) - which we do not own and attrubute all necessary rights to. *This app is for personal privacy protection only. We have no intent to monetize this product and will continue to provide it for free as long as we are able.* 

Backend source code (w/ modified versions of Fawkes) can be found [here](https://github.com/trix-co/trix-backend/tree/main).  

We are also developing a proprietary algorithm that improves upon Fawkes. We will open-source this work as well once it is complete and thouroughly evaluated. 

**We will never view your images or use your data for purposes other than understanding how users are using our service or improving our product, in aggregate.** Usage information we collect (via Amplitude):
* Photos taken or uploaded to our service
* Photos viewed and deleted from our app
* Photos shared
